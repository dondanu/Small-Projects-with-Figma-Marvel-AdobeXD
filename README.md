    <h1>HCI Prototyping Design Tools</h1>
    <p>A Deep Dive into the Top Tools for Effective Prototyping</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>There are three main developer tools used in HCI prototyping design:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Marvel</strong>: A user-friendly, web-based tool for rapid prototyping, user testing, and simple design collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Adobe XD</strong>: A vector-based design and prototyping tool for creating interactive UI/UX experiences with advanced animation and collaboration features.</li>
      <li><strong>Figma</strong>: A cloud-based design and prototyping tool that enables real-time collaboration, version control, and scalable design systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Key Features of Marvel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prototyping</strong>: Create interactive mockups without needing to write any code.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Multiple team members can work on a design at the same time, leave comments, and suggest changes.</li>
      <li><strong>User Testing</strong>: Test your design with real users and gather feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Handoff</strong>: Developers can easily receive the necessary details and files to build the actual product.</li>
    </ul>
